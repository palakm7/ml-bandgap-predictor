# Electronic Band Gap Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to predict the electronic band gaps of inorganic compounds using compositional features from the Magpie library.

## Models Used
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (best, RÂ² = 0.647)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matminer, matplotlib)
- Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model interpretability

## Outcome
Outperformed benchmark literature  (Zhuo et al., 2018) models by ~6% on regression accuracy.
